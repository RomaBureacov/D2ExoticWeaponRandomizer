# D2ExoticWeaponRandomizer
A simple command-line randomizer for randomizing which exotic weapon to use.

# Use
Simply run the executable or compile the source code yourself. Note that the WeaponsList.csv is required to be in the same location and properly formatted as the executable or compiled program. If a new weapon is appended to the game, append the said weapon to the csv. If a new weapon type is appended to the game, the source code will need to be modified to justify such. I will attempt to update it in such events.
